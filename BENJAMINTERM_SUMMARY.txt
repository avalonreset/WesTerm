BENJAMINTERM :: A WINDOWS-FIRST TERMINAL DISTRO POWERED BY WEZTERM
===================================================================

Project: https://github.com/avalonreset/BenjaminTerm
Base: WezTerm (MIT)
Identity: BenjaminTerm keeps upstream engine power, then adds workflow-first defaults for real coding sessions.


WHAT BENJAMINTERM IS
--------------------
BenjaminTerm is a custom distro/fork of WezTerm focused on one core idea:
make daily terminal work faster, cleaner, and less annoying on Windows,
without giving up cross-platform behavior for Linux friends.

It ships with opinionated defaults and practical quality-of-life controls:
- Smart copy/paste behavior
- Paste undo/redo
- Theme and font cycling
- Borderless mode + drag assist
- Pane-aware Windows notification click-to-focus
- Distinct app identity so it can coexist with stock WezTerm

In short: same serious terminal core, different personality and defaults.


THE VIBE (YES, LITERALLY)
-------------------------
Default look and feel is intentionally hacker-styled and minimal:
- Color scheme: Blue Matrix, forced pure-black background
- Default shell on Windows: pwsh.exe
- Cleaner chrome: tab bar off, focus on content
- Branding: BEN icon + BenjaminTerm naming across installer/runtime

If stock terminal defaults feel like office lighting,
BenjaminTerm is the room with the lights off and the monitor glow doing the talking.


FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS
------------------
1) Smart Ctrl+C
   - If text is selected: copy and clear selection.
   - If nothing is selected: pass through true interrupt behavior.

2) Smart Paste by Platform
   - Windows: Ctrl+V
   - Linux/macOS: Ctrl+Shift+V

3) Paste Undo / Redo (best effort)
   - Undo: Ctrl+Z
   - Redo: Ctrl+Shift+Z

4) Fast Visual Iteration
   - Cycle themes: Ctrl+Alt+T (and Shift variant)
   - Cycle fonts : Ctrl+Alt+F (and Shift variant)

5) Borderless Productivity Mode
   - Toggle borderless: Ctrl+Alt+B (and Shift variant)
   - Drag assist      : Ctrl+Alt+D (and Shift variant)

6) Notification Workflow Boost
   - Windows toast clicks can jump focus back to the exact pane/tab/window that raised the alert.

7) Side-by-Side Safety
   - Separate Windows app identity + executable naming.
   - BenjaminTerm and WezTerm can both be installed, pinned, and used independently.


HOTKEY SNAPSHOT
---------------
Ctrl+C               smart copy / pass-through interrupt
Ctrl+Alt+C           force pass-through interrupt
Ctrl+V               smart paste (Windows)
Ctrl+Shift+V         plain paste (Windows) / smart paste (Linux/macOS)
Alt+V                plain paste (Linux/macOS)
Ctrl+Z               undo recent paste
Ctrl+Shift+Z         redo recent paste (best effort)
Ctrl+Shift+R         reload config
Ctrl+F               search
Ctrl+- / Ctrl+= / 0  font size down / up / reset
Ctrl+Alt+T           cycle theme
Ctrl+Alt+F           cycle font
Ctrl+Alt+B           toggle borderless
Ctrl+Alt+D           drag window while borderless

Caps Lock survivors welcome: letter hotkeys accept Shift + non-Shift variants.


WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Because terminal users spend thousands of tiny interactions per week.
If each interaction is 1% less annoying, the compound return is huge.
BenjaminTerm is that 1% compounding project.

It is not trying to replace upstream innovation.
It is trying to package a workflow opinion that is immediately usable.


CURRENT REALITY CHECK (THE META SECTION)
----------------------------------------
BenjaminTerm improved behavior significantly for daily use,
but live width-resize edge cases can still be rough under specific flows.

Translation: it is genuinely better, not magically perfect.

Or, in terminal dialect:
- Fast? yes.
- Useful? yes.
- Stylish? aggressively yes.
- Immune to resize chaos in every possible case? not yet.

That is still a valid release state when the practical experience is better.


BENJAMINTERM IN ONE SENTENCE
----------------------------
BenjaminTerm is WezTerm with a hacker persona, workflow-first defaults,
and enough practical shortcuts to make everyday terminal work feel intentional.


BENJAMINTERM IN TWO SENTENCES (FOR PEOPLE WHO SCROLL)
------------------------------------------------------
BenjaminTerm keeps the proven WezTerm core and layers on quality-of-life features that matter in real coding loops.
It favors pragmatic gains over perfection theatre: ship improvements, keep iterating, stay usable.


EPILOGUE
--------
You can call it a fork.
You can call it a distro.
You can call it "the terminal that finally stopped arguing with my muscle memory."

All three are true.
